### **1. LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)**
- **Definition**: Natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state at around -162째C (-260째F) for easier storage and transportation.
- **Importance**: LNG allows natural gas to be transported across oceans in a more manageable and efficient manner, often from regions with abundant natural gas reserves to those with high demand but limited pipeline infrastructure.

### **2. LNG Terminal**
- **Definition**: A facility designed for the receiving, unloading, storage, regasification, and distribution of LNG. It can also be used for LNG export purposes, including liquefaction.
- **Importance**: LNG terminals play a crucial role in the global LNG supply chain, enabling the import or export of liquefied natural gas to/from different markets.

### **3. Liquefaction Terminal**
- **Definition**: A facility where natural gas is converted into LNG by cooling it to a liquid state.
- **Importance**: Liquefaction terminals are typically located in regions rich in natural gas resources, allowing them to export LNG to global markets.

### **4. Regasification Terminal**
- **Definition**: A facility that receives LNG, stores it, and then converts it back into gaseous form (regasification) for distribution through pipelines.
- **Importance**: Regasification terminals are typically located in consumer markets where natural gas is needed for power generation, heating, or industrial use.

### **5. Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU)**
- **Definition**: A mobile unit, often a ship, that combines storage and regasification capabilities. It allows LNG to be regasified offshore or near-shore and distributed through pipelines.
- **Importance**: FSRUs provide a flexible and cost-effective solution for LNG importation, especially in regions with limited onshore infrastructure.

### **6. Storage Tank**
- **Definition**: Large tanks at an LNG terminal used to store LNG at cryogenic temperatures until it is either exported or regasified.
- **Importance**: LNG storage tanks ensure the safe and efficient management of liquefied natural gas during its transport and distribution.

### **7. Send-Out Capacity**
- **Definition**: The maximum amount of LNG that a terminal can regasify and send out through pipelines per unit of time, typically expressed in million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) or gigajoules per hour (GJ/h).
- **Importance**: Send-out capacity is a critical factor for determining the throughput and operational efficiency of regasification terminals.

### **8. LNG Export Terminal**
- **Definition**: A terminal designed to process natural gas into LNG for export to international markets.
- **Importance**: LNG export terminals are essential for global trade in natural gas, particularly for countries with abundant natural gas resources but limited domestic demand.

### **9. LNG Import Terminal**
- **Definition**: A terminal where LNG is imported, stored, and regasified for domestic use, typically in countries with limited domestic natural gas production.
- **Importance**: Import terminals enable countries to diversify their energy sources and secure a reliable supply of natural gas.

### **10. LNG Carrier**
- **Definition**: Specialized ships designed to transport LNG in a liquid state, with insulated tanks that maintain the cryogenic temperature.
- **Importance**: LNG carriers are the main vessels for transporting liquefied natural gas over long distances across oceans.

### **11. Regasification Process**
- **Definition**: The process of converting LNG back into its gaseous state by heating it up to its natural temperature and pressure before distribution through pipelines.
- **Importance**: This process is essential for making LNG usable in power generation, heating, and industrial processes.

### **12. Cryogenic**
- **Definition**: Refers to extremely low temperatures, typically below -150째C (-238째F), which are necessary for liquefying natural gas.
- **Importance**: Cryogenic technology is essential in LNG terminals for both the liquefaction and storage of LNG.

### **13. Boil-Off Gas (BOG)**
- **Definition**: The natural gas that evaporates from LNG during storage or transport due to temperature fluctuations.
- **Importance**: BOG is typically recondensed into LNG for storage, or used as fuel for the LNG terminal or the LNG carrier.

### **14. Trunk Line**
- **Definition**: A large-diameter pipeline that transports gas from an LNG terminal to the main distribution network or power plants.
- **Importance**: Trunk lines are essential in ensuring the delivery of regasified natural gas to consumers across large regions.

### **15. FID (Final Investment Decision)**
- **Definition**: The formal decision made by project developers to proceed with the construction of an LNG terminal.
- **Importance**: FID is a key milestone in the development of any LNG terminal, marking the start of significant capital expenditure and construction work.

### **16. Peak Shaving**
- **Definition**: The process of using LNG to supply gas to the grid during periods of high demand, thus "shaving" off the peak demand.
- **Importance**: Peak shaving helps maintain stable supply during demand spikes, particularly in regions with fluctuating seasonal or daily natural gas needs.

### **17. LNG Hub**
- **Definition**: A market location or terminal where LNG is traded and acts as a key point for the distribution of LNG to multiple destinations.
- **Importance**: LNG hubs facilitate market liquidity, pricing, and the efficient allocation of LNG resources to various global markets.

### **18. Carbon Intensity of LNG**
- **Definition**: The amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of energy produced from LNG, typically measured in grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour (gCO2/kWh).
- **Importance**: The carbon intensity of LNG is an important metric for evaluating the environmental impact of LNG compared to other energy sources.

### **19. LNG Supply Chain**
- **Definition**: The complete network of processes and infrastructure involved in producing, liquefying, storing, transporting, regasifying, and distributing LNG.
- **Importance**: Understanding the LNG supply chain is crucial for assessing the efficiency and resilience of the global LNG market.

### **20. LNG Price Benchmark**
- **Definition**: A reference price used to evaluate the cost of LNG in global markets, often based on long-term contracts or spot market prices.
- **Importance**: LNG price benchmarks are essential for buyers, sellers, and analysts in tracking market trends and making informed purchasing decisions.
